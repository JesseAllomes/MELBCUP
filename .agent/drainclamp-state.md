# DrainClamp state

<!-- DC:ARCH -->
Greenfield (audit: 0 files, stack unknown). Planned layout, Python 3.13 package `melbcup`:
- melbcup/config.py -> env settings (FORMFAV_API_KEY, PUNTERSEDGE_API_KEY, APP_PASSWORD, POLL_SECONDS) -> load_settings()
- melbcup/sources/ -> FormFav + PuntersEdge HTTP clients, TTL cache, credit-aware backoff -> FormFavClient, PuntersEdgeClient
- melbcup/domain.py -> normalised Meeting/Race/Runner/Price dataclasses (both feeds map into these)
- melbcup/model/ -> runner features (form, class, distance, track/going, jockey, trainer, barrier, weight, bias) -> win probabilities blended with market consensus; place probs via Harville/Henery
- melbcup/bets/ -> value (EV) for Win/Place/Each-way; Trifecta + First Four (Harville enumeration); Early/Main Quaddie; cross-race win multis; fractional-Kelly staking
- melbcup/live.py -> background poller refreshing data and recomputing picks
- melbcup/web/ -> FastAPI app, mobile-first HTML, auto-refresh, HTTP Basic password -> uvicorn melbcup.web.app:app
- render.yaml -> Render free-tier deploy
API specs: .agent/api/formfav-openapi.json, .agent/api/pe-openapi.json (both auth header X-API-Key).
Optimisation vectors: PuntersEdge /v1/racing/consensus, /markets, /tote (exotics), /acceptances, /horses/runs overlap FormFav; prefer one call per race per poll; cache form (static on the day), poll only prices.

<!-- DC:DECISIONS -->
Target -> Flemington, Melbourne Cup day Tue 3 Nov 2026, every race on the card (user)
Purpose -> data-driven value picks; best educated decisions, no guarantees (user)
Bet types -> Win, Place, Each-way, Trifecta, Quad, Multi where possible (user)
"Quad" meaning -> Quaddie (Early Quaddie + Main Quaddie); First Four also shown per race (repo decision)
Inputs -> long-form history, horse, jockey, trainer, owner and other relevant data (user)
Data sources -> FormFav Pro (7-day trial covers Cup day) for form/predictions/jockey/trainer/runner stats/track bias + PuntersEdge free key for bookmaker win/place prices incl Sportsbet, tote, consensus (user accepted recommendation)
No Betfair (user has no account); no scraping of racing.com/TAB/Sportsbet (user + terms of use)
Secrets -> env vars FORMFAV_API_KEY, PUNTERSEDGE_API_KEY, APP_PASSWORD only; never in repo or chat (repo decision)
Owner data -> PuntersEdge acceptances carry owner; shown per runner, not weighted (no owner strike-rate feed) (repo decision)
Hosting -> online free tier (Render), password protected, phone-first, works on mobile data (user)
Live -> app refreshes data and re-ranks picks automatically; polling interval respects API credit limits (user + repo decision)
Stakes -> rank picks; optional budget input gives quarter-Kelly stakes with per-bet cap; never places bets (repo decision; user did not choose)
Missing data -> show "no data" and skip the pick; never fabricate prices or probabilities (repo decision)
Stack -> Python 3.13, FastAPI, uvicorn, httpx, jinja2; dev: pytest, ruff (repo decision)
Deadline -> usable by Mon 2 Nov evening AEDT; Cup day fields final Sat 31 Oct (user)
Responsible gambling footer with Gambling Help Online 1800 858 858 on every page (repo decision)
PuntersEdge is required (field, scratchings, prices); FormFav is optional enrichment and every FormFav failure degrades to a visible warning (repo decision)
Market consensus computed locally from /markets (per-book normalise, median) to save credits; /consensus endpoint not used (repo decision)
Test payloads are synthetic but follow the vendor OpenAPI specs in .agent/api/; vendor examples kept in tests/fixtures for shape checks (repo decision)
Exotics: no pre-race tote dividends exist in either feed, so trifecta/first four/quaddie show hit chance + fair dividend; one structure per type is "recommended" (cheapest with hit chance >= threshold) (repo decision)
Quaddie legs -> Main = last 4 races, Early = 4 before; UI tells user to check bookmaker legs (repo decision)
Multis -> Sportsbet win prices only (multis must be with one bookie); legs >= 15% win chance (repo decision)
Staking -> quarter Kelly capped 5%/bet; exotics 1% of budget each (recommended only); total scaled to budget (repo decision)
App password required: without APP_PASSWORD pages answer 503 with setup text (repo decision)
Prices -> /racing/next-to-go (free plan, 2 credits whole card); /racing/markets needs Plus and is not used (repo decision, real-data test)
Credits -> manual mode default: Load card (~2+3/race) and Refresh prices (2) buttons; Auto optional via toggle or PRICE_MODE=auto; credits left shown on every page (user)
Hosting -> Render, deployed by user from main (user)
Model weights -> fitted by melbcup/backtest.py on 1,131 races 29 Sep-29 Oct 2026 (pre-race RA acceptances + FormFav point-in-time form vs official SP/results); blend market 1.0 + model 0.3; FormFav rating enters as a factor (repo decision, backtest)
VALUE rule -> edge between required_edge(price) and +40%, win price <= $21 (held-out ROI at SP +9.8% over 1,075 bets; not proven) (repo decision, backtest)
Jockey/trainer factors kept: held-out accuracy identical with or without them (repo decision, backtest)
FormFav key now on free plan and over quota until 2026-10-30 08:05Z after backtest collection; client stops calling refused features per load; Pro re-subscription is the user's call (user pending)
